# Python_Olist_Growth_Analytics
Python and SQL analysis of Olist's e-commerce data to strategize post-pandemic growth, focusing on sales funnel optimization.

This repository encapsulates an analysis focused on strategizing Olist's (Brazilian startup https://olist.com/) growth sustainability after a pandemic-induced surge. The analysis, grounded in SQL and Python, leverages data across the sales funnel stages and Olist's operational database to extract insights into customer acquisition, sales conversion, and retention.

The examination reveals sales funnel performance, highlighting conversion efficacy from leads generated through digital marketing to merchant acquisition and product listings. The work includes SQL data preparation, Python exploratory analysis, statistical testing, and predictive modeling to inform sales and product demand forecasts.

The findings aim to provide Olist with data-driven strategies for funnel efficiency and partnership leverage with major Latin American marketplaces, underpinning its position as a leading e-commerce entity.
